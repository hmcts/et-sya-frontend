Convention rights are the rights and fundamental freedoms as set out in the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nThe tribunal also has certain other powers to sit in private or to restrict publicity in accordance with sections 10A, 10B, 11 and 12 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996.\n\nThe tribunal may issue an order:\n\nthat a hearing that would otherwise be in public be conducted, in whole or in part, in private\nthat the identities of specified parties, witnesses or other persons referred to in the proceedings should not be disclosed to the public, by the use of anonymisation or otherwise\nfor measures preventing witnesses at a public hearing being identifiable by members of the public\nrestricting the reporting of the case in the media\n\nDetails to include in your application:\n\nhow the tribunal should prevent or restrict publicity in your case. For example, tell us which parts or aspects of the case we should not publicise\nwhy the restrictions you want are needed. The tribunal must make the least restrictive order possible.
