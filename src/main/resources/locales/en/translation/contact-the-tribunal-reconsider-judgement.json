This therefore excludes any decision that does not comprise a final determination of the claim, or part of a claim. If you wish to ask for a case management order to be varied or revoked, use the vary or revoke an order application.\n\nYou can only ask the tribunal to reconsider a judgment within 14 days of the date the judgment was sent to you.\n\nIf you want the tribunal to reconsider a judgment that was sent to you over 14 days ago you must explain why your application is late. \n\nA reconsideration application does not affect the time limit for appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.\n\nDetails to include in your application:\n\nthe judgment you want reconsidered \nthe date the tribunal issued the judgment\nyour reason for a late application if the judgment was sent over 14 days ago\nwhy it is in the interests of justice to reconsider this judgment\nif the tribunal should vary or revoke the judgment\nany additional information or material which the tribunal does not already have to support your application"
